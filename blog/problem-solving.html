        <h4>1. That time I was blocked on a simpmle problem.</h4>
        <p>
          During the Gradebook task in javascript kata, I encountered a problem
          where my code would just did not work, I spent so much time trying to
          figure out what the problem was, going through my code line by line,
          replacing pieces of code that I think might be the problem. I explain
          to myself what each line of code was supposed to do but I couldn't
          resolve the issue. I took a break, came back and finally realised that
          I was not calling one of my functions.
        </p>

        <h4>2. That time when I elegantly solved a problem.</h4>
        <p>
          When writing the function for whereAreYou I was surprised how quickly
          I finished the task, I was able to figure out how to go through the
          array of items, access the right property to find Scooby in one line
          of code.
        </p>

        <h4>
          3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
          problem-solving techniques/processes.
        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Pseudocode:</b> I have tried writing pseudocode for each of the
          tasks, but I always find myself missing steps and needing to add in
          code. <br />
          <b>Trying something:</b> When I get presented a problem, I have a
          general idea on how to solve the problem, but when it doesn't work, I
          like to mess around to see what makes what work.<br />
          <b>Rubber ducky method:</b> When my mind is fresh the rubber ducky is
          effective and I can sometimes solve my problems with it, but if I'm
          tired and frustrated, theere is no chance the rubber ducky method
          would work for me. <br />
          <b>Reading error messages:</b> Whenever I encounter an error, I would
          read the error message first to get an idea what kind of problem I am
          dealing with. Many of my problems have been solved with the initial
          step of reading the error message.<br />
          <b>Console.logging:</b> I console log a lot, trying to find out
          whether my function is working or not, or finding out what a line of
          code is outputting is incredibly useful information and helped
          tremendously in searching where my bugs are. <br />
          <b>Googling:</b> Google is good for most things, if I have no idea how
          to approach a problem, a google search would usually give me a
          solution. If I forgot how to use a method or function, a quick google
          search would instantly put me back on track. <br />
          <b>Asking your peers for help:</b> I have not asked for much help from
          my peers but I'm confident in my ability to ask for help. <br />
          <b>Asking coaches for help:</b> As the same as asking my peers for
          help. <br />
          <b>Improving your process with reflection:</b> I don't really find the
          reflection writing very helpful, maybe even a bit tedious, but I know
          it's important to reflect on what I've learnt so I'll continue to
          reflect but I'll find a different way.
        </p>
        <h4>
          4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant ot ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differntly next time?
        </h4>
        <p>
          When I get stuck on a problem, I know if I spend enough time on it,
          I'll be able to find the solution myself and that might be a good
          feeling to me but it may not be the best way to go through the
          bootcamp. As I don't want to fall behind because of spending too much
          time on a singular problem, next time I'll need to set myself an
          appropriate amount of time to solve a problem and call for help if I
          don't solve it in the given time.
