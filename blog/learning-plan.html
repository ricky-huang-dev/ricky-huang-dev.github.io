        <h4>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p class="content">
          My long term goal is to be in the tech industry and hope that when the
          bootcamp is finished I'll be a competent programmer.
        </p>

          2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h4>
        <p class="content">
          When I start to work, I get into a rhythm of doing work and can go on
          for hours, but if I don't come back to it for a few days, I'll have a
          hard time starting back up and would need to get back into the mindset
          of doing work.
        </p>

        <h4>
          3. What skills(non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developoed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p class="content">
          The importance of being able to effectively communicate is crucial in
          a team environment. As in bring able to concisely explain problems or
          solutions to another team member without leaving them more confused.
        </p>

        <h4>
          4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
          programme.
        </h4>
        <p class="content">
          Throughout the learning journey I may keep a checklist of all the
          things I've learnt, if I'm feeling confident for a subject I'll note
          it down, if I'm struggling I'll write down and keep in mind to spend
          some extra time on the subject im struggling in. If there's too much
          work built up and I'm struggling to get through them, I'll take a
          break or check in with others and get some advice on how to manage my
          workload or problem.
        </p>

        <h4>
          5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
          way.
        </h4>

        <p class="content">
          I like to accomplish the tasks on my own but when I get stuck on a
          problem and I've sunk more time than the suggested time box, I can ask
          on the Dev Academy discord for help and the facilitators will be there
          to help out.
        </p>

        <h4>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h4>
        <p class="content">
          So far in the foundation all the facilitators has been wonderful, it's
          a friendly and healthy environment where the teachers are approachable
          and students are able to freely ask questions.
        </p>

        <h4>
          7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

        <p class="content">
          Sometimes I would need to drop off/pick up family from work but other
          than that my schedule should be open
