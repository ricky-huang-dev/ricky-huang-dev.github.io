        <h4>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h4>
        <p>
          1. Through practice and practice, I am able to learn new skills such
          as coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Even though the reflections are my least favourite task, I know
          self reflection. is an important part of the learning process.
        </p>

        <p>
          3. I need to set time limits for myself, otherwise I might just be
          wasting time instead of learning.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Understanding values, empathy and self awareness is important for a
          team to work together. It would help you understand each other more,
          and know what to expect from your peers.
        </p>
        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          I was surprised as to just how important the mindset of programmer is.
          For example, as a programmer you will need to be able to adapt quickly
          as there are almost infinite amount of things to learn in a
          programming language.
        </p>
        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          For me the most challenging parts of core learning was writing the
          reflections and the blog. My writing skills is weak, so the activities
          involving writing I tend to put on the back burner.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Knowing your own strengths and weaknesses may help you in the course
          of learning.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Personally I wouldn't say I enjoyed the core learning much, but they
          weren't a waste of time. They helped me understand who I am, taught me
          the mindset of a programmer, and somewhat improve my writing skills.
          Although I do feel the core learning aspect of the foundation could be
          reduced for more coding practice.
